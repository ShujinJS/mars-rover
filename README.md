# mars-rover
A testable (with Jest.js) mars rover project, you may command the rover giving an input to the bottom control panel. Commands are L (Left), R (Right), M (Move) and C (Capture). Left and Right commands make the rover turn 90 degree and Move command makes the rover move according to the direction the rover 1 grid it faces. Capture just takes a random photo of the terrain, you may encounter a selfy of the rover :)

You need to install node modules (npm init) for the missing files.
